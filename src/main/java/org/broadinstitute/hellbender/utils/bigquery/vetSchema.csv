reference_name, STRING, NULLABLE, Reference name.
start_position, INTEGER, NULLABLE, Start position (0-based). Corresponds to the first base of the string of reference bases.
end_position, INTEGER, NULLABLE, End position (0-based). Corresponds to the first base after the last base in the reference allele.
reference_bases, STRING, NULLABLE, Reference bases.
alternate_bases, RECORD, REPEATED, One record for each alternate base (if any).
alternate_bases.alt, STRING, NULLABLE, Alternate base.
alternate_bases.AC, INTEGER, NULLABLE, Allele count in genotypes for each ALT allele in the same order as listed
alternate_bases.AF, FLOAT, NULLABLE, Allele Frequency for each ALT allele in the same order as listed
names, STRING, REPEATED, Variant names (e.g. RefSNP ID).
quality, FLOAT, NULLABLE, Phred-scaled quality score (-10log10 prob(call is wrong)). Higher values imply better quality.
filter, STRING, REPEATED, List of failed filters (if any) or "PASS" indicating the variant has passed all filters.
call, RECORD, REPEATED, One record for each call.
call.name, STRING, NULLABLE, Name of the call.
call.genotype, INTEGER, REPEATED, Genotype of the call. "-1" is used in cases where the genotype is not called.
call.phaseset, STRING, NULLABLE, Phaseset of the call (if any). "*" is used in cases where the genotype is phased but no phase set ("PS" in FORMAT) was specified.
call.AD, INTEGER, REPEATED, Allelic depths for the ref and alt alleles in the order listed
call.DP, INTEGER, NULLABLE, Approximate read depth (reads with MQ=255 or with bad mates are filtered)
call.GQ, INTEGER, NULLABLE, Genotype Quality
call.MIN_DP, INTEGER, NULLABLE, Minimum DP observed within the GVCF block
call.PGT, STRING, NULLABLE, Physical phasing haplotype information describing how the alternate alleles are phased in relation to one another
call.PID, STRING, NULLABLE, Physical phasing ID information where each unique ID within a given sample (but not across samples) connects records within a phasing group
call.PL, INTEGER, REPEATED, Normalized Phred-scaled likelihoods for genotypes as defined in the VCF specification
call.SB, INTEGER, REPEATED, Per-sample component statistics which comprise the Fisher's Exact Test to detect strand bias.
AN, INTEGER, NULLABLE, Total number of alleles in called genotypes
BaseQRankSum, FLOAT, NULLABLE, Z-score from Wilcoxon rank sum test of Alt Vs. Ref base qualities
ClippingRankSum, FLOAT, NULLABLE, Z-score From Wilcoxon rank sum test of Alt vs. Ref number of hard clipped bases
DP, INTEGER, NULLABLE, Approximate read depth; some reads may have been filtered
ExcessHet, FLOAT, NULLABLE, Phred-scaled p-value for exact test of excess heterozygosity
MQ, FLOAT, NULLABLE, RMS Mapping Quality
MQRankSum, FLOAT, NULLABLE, Z-score From Wilcoxon rank sum test of Alt vs. Ref read mapping qualities
MQ_DP, INTEGER, NULLABLE, Depth over variant samples for better MQ calculation
QUALapprox, INTEGER, NULLABLE, Sum of PL[0] values; used to approximate the QUAL score
RAW_MQ, FLOAT, NULLABLE, Raw data for RMS Mapping Quality
ReadPosRankSum, FLOAT, NULLABLE, Z-score from Wilcoxon rank sum test of Alt vs. Ref read position bias
VarDP, INTEGER, NULLABLE, (informative) depth over variant genotypes
